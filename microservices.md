# MicroServices

Each microservice has to have his own folder in the ./ and ./kubernetes directories.

-   The folder in ./kubernetes creates the service for that service.
-   The folder in ./ contains any logic and builds docker images for that service.

## Desired MicroService list

-   ImalApi
-   AuthService
    -   AuthDataBase
-   MALService
-   AdsService?
-   MailService
    -   Mail Server

## Current MicroService list
